#### Functionalities I've implemented so far:

* Listing all categories in sidebar, and being able to display all news that belong to chosen category
* Separate log in for users and administrators
* Sign up
* Log out
* Client side validation
* Server side validation
* SQL injection prevention
* Session
* Showing username of the person who logged in on each page
* Showing sign in options only when there is no person logged in
* If a person is logged in, show log out option
* Pagination system
* Displaying a chosen article (with images and their sources)
* Cookies
* Users, administrators and anonymous people can add comments to articles (I need to implement AJAX functionality still)


I've also created the database and tables, and worked on design.
#### Functionalities I need to implemet:
* Users can delete their own comments
